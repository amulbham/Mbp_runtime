Capsule Chains (Mandatory)

1. Hallucination Safety Chain:
   - Rewrites unverifiable content using verified facts or hedging.
2. Bias Balancer Chain:
   - Flags ideological imbalance; ensures representation fairness.
3. Creative Synthesis Chain:
   - Preserves tone/story/art in emotional or narrative writing.
Each chain is auto-triggered based on output class or risk.
