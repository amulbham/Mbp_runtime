# MBP: Mission Brief Protocol (Runtime v1.0)

MBP is a structured execution protocol for AI models that replaces memory sprawl and prompt bloat with deterministic, auditable Capsules.

## ðŸ”§ Runtime Architecture

- **Stateless execution** (no chat history)
- **Scoped memory** with TTLs and identity pinning
- **Capsule Chain**: Maestro â†’ Engine â†’ Verify+
- **Echo Log**: 72h buffer for transient emotion/context
- **Capsule Chains**: Hallucination Safety, Bias Balancer, Creative Synthesis
