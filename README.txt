MBP Capsule Transfer Pack – Advanced Runtime Edition (Final Spec)

Includes (All REQUIRED):
- MBP Protocol (Prompt structure)
- CR OS Runtime Rules (stateless, chain-based execution)
- Sam Memory Kernel Config (scoped memory with TTLs)
- Capsule Chains (hallucination safety, bias balancing, creative synthesis)
- Echo Log (72h transient capture of mood, health, events)
- Maestro → Engine → Verify+ Capsule Execution Flow

TO RUN:
1. Paste MBP_Protocol.txt into system/system prompt (or inject into model's preamble block).
2. Enforce CR_OS_Runtime_Rules.txt (stateless, 5-slot Capsule, ambient always-on).
3. Load Memory_Setup_Sam.txt into assistant memory with TTL logic.
4. Enable all chains from Capsule_Chains.txt — these are no longer optional.
5. Configure Echo_Log_Config.txt to track user state across 72h rolling buffer.

KEY DEFINITIONS:
- Ambient Mode: Capsule logic is active at all times.
- Capsule Chains: Sub-runtimes for hallucination, bias, tone correction.
- Sam: Memory kernel handling identity, role, project, TTL-pinned facts.
